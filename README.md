## Description
PDF-installer is a command-line program written in C# that allows you to install and uninstall PDF files for later use.
But here's the catchâ€”it's intentionally written with messy and inefficient code as a joke!

## Features
- Install a specified PDF file
- Uninstall a previously installed PDF file
- Launch installed PDF files using the provided command

## Usage (If You Dare)

Install a specified PDF file.
```pdf install <file_path>```

Uninstall a previously installed PDF file.
```pdf uninstall <filename>```

Display help for the command.
```pdf --help```

## Note

To launch an installed PDF file, use the "pdf_" prefix followed by the file name (with no file extention). Or just cross your fingers and hope it works. Good luck!

## Requirements (Your Patience)

- .NET Framework
- A sense of humor
